# Marktplaats Deal Automator

This project automates buying and selling deals on Marktplaats.nl.

## Core Features
1. **Search Automation** – Enter filters (price range, location radius, keywords, categories) and automatically scrape listings.
2. **Listing Analysis** – Use Gemini AI to read listing descriptions, seller profiles, and images, rating each deal for resale potential.
3. **Automated Negotiations** – Start conversations with sellers using predefined personas. Configure budget, meeting location, and payment method.
4. **Resale Value Calculation** – Pull data from sites such as Autoscout24, Autotrader, RDW, or scraped Marktplaats sold listings to estimate resale value.
5. **Dashboard** – Track deals, conversations, success rate, and time saved. View active negotiations and manage search profiles.

The current codebase contains scaffolding for these features and can be extended into a full flipping assistant.
